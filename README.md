# PyBear Analysis

## Project Overview

In this challenge, we were tasked with calculating the following metrics based on city type which are "Urban, Suburban & Rural. Amounts of rides, amount of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver. The purpose was to visualize the data in a graph which we did by using the .plot function in order to see what the trends looked like, with the total fare $ in the y axis and the timeline on the x axis by weeks which were shown in months. 

## Results of the Data
The image titled "PyBer_fare_summary.png" showed that the Urban had the most $ in terms of total fares by week, followed by Suburban & lastly Rural. There were sudden spikes in the chart as well, specifically the week right before March, all of the fares spiked, which could then be used to see if this was tied to a specific event or holiday. 
The data also showed the following metrics:
Rides by city type
Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

Drivers by city type:
Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

Total Fares in USD$ by city type
Rural        4327.93
Suburban    19356.33
Urban       39854.38

Avg. fare by city type:
Rural       34.623440
Suburban    30.970128
Urban       24.525772

Avg fare by driver in city types:
Rural       55.486282
Suburban    39.502714
Urban       16.571468

From this data, we could conclude that Urban is at the top followed by Suburban & Rural when it comes to total drivers, total rides, & total amount of fares. However, Rural was the highest followed by Suburban & Urban when it came to avg fare by city type & avg fare by driver. This could possibly be explained because rural cities have less drivers so the supply is constrained and therefore, the amount of $dollars charged is higher. Having fewer drivers, concentrates the $ to a select few which is why the avg fare per driver is probably higher too. Rural cities also tend to be more spread out, so distance traveled in the fares could be further. 

## Recommendation to CEO:
1. My first recommendation would be to have the strategy team look at the sudden spike in week 3 of February. Every city type seems to have a jump in total fares$ and this could be something that the company's app is not capitalizing on. Finding out the root cause would be helpful to better prepare for a higher demand in rides so we could service everyone. One of the reasons the fares probably shot up might be because there was an event that caused more rides than normal and therefore, each ride was more expensive & there could be the possibility of people not being able to find a ride either which is a loss in revenue. 
2. My second recommendation would be to deduce why the avg fare by city type & avg fare by driver is higher in Rural cities. Although they do not capture most of the revenue in this time frame, it would be important to see why they are more profitable because then, the company can make decisions on how to transfer this profitability to its cash cow, urban areas. 
3. My third recommendation is to shift the focus on Suburban fares, they make up half of the urban fare's revenue but they are also high in profitability for their drivers and average fare per ride. By understanding this city type, the company can easily grow its revenue on the Suburban city type and make it into a more profitable part of their business, which will increase their net profit & also make their drivers really happy since they are getting really good avg fares by driver.
